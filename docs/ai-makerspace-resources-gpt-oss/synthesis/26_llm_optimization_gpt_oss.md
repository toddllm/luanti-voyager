**LLM Optimization in Luanti Voyager – Quick‑Start Guide**  
*(≤ 500 words – code‑centric, practical steps)*

### 1. What is LLM Optimization?  
LLM Optimization means tailoring a large language model (LLM) so it runs fast, uses little memory, and still delivers high‑quality text for a game. In Luanti Voyager this usually involves quantization, batching, caching, and efficient prompt design so NPC AI can react in real‑time without stalling the game loop.  

---

### 2. How to Implement it for Game AI Agents  

- **Choose a lightweight model** – e.g., Llama‑7B, Phi‑2, or a 4‑bit quantized variant.  
- **Quantize locally** – use `llama.cpp` or `optimum` to convert the model to 4‑bit or 8‑bit.  
- **Pre‑load the model** on game start; keep it in RAM to avoid I/O stalls.  
- **Use a prompt template** that includes only the necessary context (player actions, nearby terrain, NPC personality).  
- **Batch small requests** – collect 3–5 NPC queries per frame and send them in one inference call.  
- **Cache common embeddings** – e.g., terrain descriptors, quest items, and reuse them across NPCs.  
- **Stream the output** – use token‑by‑token streaming so the NPC can start speaking while the rest of the text is generated.  
- **Set a token limit** (e.g., 64 tokens) to keep latency below 100 ms.  
- **Fallback to deterministic rules** when the model latency spikes or when the player is far away.

### 3. One Simple Code Example (Lua)

```lua
-- Load a 4‑bit quantized Llama model (assumes llm.lua wrapper)
local llm = require("llm")          -- custom Lua binding to llama.cpp
local model = llm.load("models/llama-7b-4bit.gguf")

-- Prompt template
local function build_prompt(npc, player_pos, nearby_items)
    return string.format(
        [[You are %s, an NPC in Luanti Voyager.
        Player is at (%.2f, %.2f). Nearby items: %s.
        Respond in one short sentence.]],
        npc.name, player_pos.x, player_pos.y,
        table.concat(nearby_items, ", ")
    )
end

-- Generate dialogue for a single NPC
local function npc_talk(npc, player_pos, nearby_items)
    local prompt = build_prompt(npc, player_pos, nearby_items)
    local response = model:infer(prompt, { max_tokens = 32 })
    print(npc.name .. " says: " .. response)
end

-- Example usage in game loop
local player_pos = {x=120.5, y=34.0}
local npc = {name="OldMiner"}
local items = {"pickaxe", "ore"}
npc_talk(npc, player_pos, items)
```

*Explanation:*  
- `llm.load` loads the quantized GGUF file once.  
- `build_prompt` constructs a minimal context.  
- `model:infer` runs inference synchronously; the binding can expose async streaming if needed.  

---

### 4. Game‑Specific Use Case  

**Dynamic Quest Generation for NPCs**  
- When a player enters a new biome, trigger the LLM to generate a quest prompt:  
  ```
  "In the %s biome, the local village needs help with %s. What quest can you offer?"
  ```
- Use the cached embedding of the biome type to speed up inference.  
- Return the quest description to the NPC dialogue system, allowing the NPC to explain objectives, rewards, and optional hints in natural language.  
- Because the model is optimized, the quest can be generated on‑the‑fly within 150 ms, keeping the game responsive even on mid‑range hardware.

**Takeaway:**  
Quantize, preload, batch, cache, and keep prompts lean. With a small Lua wrapper around a lightweight GGUF model you can give Luanti Voyager’s NPCs a touch of AI‑powered dynamism without sacrificing performance.
