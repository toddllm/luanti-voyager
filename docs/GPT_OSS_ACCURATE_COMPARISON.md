# GPT-OSS vs Qwen2.5: Accurate Comparison Report

## Important Clarification

Previous reports contained inaccuracies. This is the corrected analysis based on actual data.

## Actual Test Conditions

### Transcript Availability
- **Only 1 topic had a transcript**: Vector Memory (36KB transcript → 6000 chars used)
- **9 topics had NO transcripts**: Synthesized using only context + notebook code
- Prompts ranged from 2010 to 8215 characters

### What Was Actually Tested

| Topic | Transcript? | Notebook? | Prompt Size | GPT-OSS Time | Output Size |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Vector Memory | ✅ Yes (6000 chars) | ❌ No | 8,215 chars | 3.8 min | 27.5 KB |
| Planner Executor | ❌ No | ❌ No | 2,158 chars | 2.9 min | 22.8 KB |
| Multi-Agent Swarm | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (26 cells) | 3,143 chars | 2.3 min | 18.4 KB |
| MCP/A2A Protocols | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (6 cells) | 5,240 chars | 2.9 min | 23.0 KB |
| Production RAG | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (43 cells) | 2,489 chars | 2.7 min | 19.6 KB |
| LLM Optimization | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (20 cells) | 2,330 chars | 2.6 min | 20.2 KB |
| Guardrails | ❌ No | ❌ No | 2,065 chars | 2.2 min | 20.5 KB |
| Agent Observability | ❌ No | ❌ No | 2,010 chars | 2.4 min | 20.2 KB |
| Fine-tuning | ❌ No | ❌ No | 2,067 chars | 2.9 min | 22.9 KB |
| Agent Evaluation | ❌ No | ❌ No | 2,013 chars | 1.9 min | 16.5 KB |

## Key Findings

### 1. Timeout Issue Was Real
- With timeouts: GPT-OSS appeared to fail on large prompts
- Without timeouts: GPT-OSS handled all prompts successfully
- **Conclusion**: Removing timeouts is essential for GPT-OSS

### 2. Limited Data for Comparison
- Only 1 topic (Vector Memory) tested with actual transcript content
- Other topics used structured prompts with context but no transcript
- Cannot claim "GPT-OSS handles full transcripts" based on 1 example

### 3. Performance Observations
- **With transcript** (Vector Memory): 3.8 minutes, 27.5KB output
- **Without transcript** (others): 1.9-2.9 minutes, 16-23KB output
- Average time: 2.7 minutes (but mostly without transcripts)

## Corrected Conclusions

1. **GPT-OSS handles large prompts** when timeouts are removed (proven with 8KB prompt)
2. **Speed comparison is incomplete** - only 1 topic had comparable data
3. **Output size varies** based on input content availability
4. **Most synthesis used only context**, not actual transcripts

## What We Can Confidently Say

✅ GPT-OSS successfully processed all 10 topics without timeouts
✅ GPT-OSS handled an 8,215 character prompt (Vector Memory)
✅ Removing timeouts is critical for GPT-OSS success
✅ GPT-OSS produces comprehensive output even without transcripts

## What We Cannot Claim

❌ "GPT-OSS is 2-3x faster than qwen2.5 on identical content" (only 1 comparable example)
❌ "GPT-OSS handles full 6000-char transcripts for all topics" (only 1 had a transcript)
❌ "Complete fair comparison" (different input data between models)

## Recommendations

1. **For topics WITH transcripts**: GPT-OSS can handle them without timeouts
2. **For topics WITHOUT transcripts**: Both models produce good results from context alone
3. **Critical setting**: Always remove timeouts when using GPT-OSS
4. **Need more data**: Test with more topics that have actual transcripts for fair comparison

## Next Steps

To make a truly fair comparison:
1. Obtain transcripts for all 10 topics
2. Run both models with identical inputs
3. Compare timing and output quality
4. Document actual transcript sizes used

The current results show GPT-OSS is capable but don't support broad performance claims due to limited comparable data.
