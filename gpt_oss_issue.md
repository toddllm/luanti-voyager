# Research: Incorporate GPT-OSS Harmony Response Format into Luanti Voyager Agent Architecture

## üî¨ Research Proposal: GPT-OSS Integration

### Background
We've successfully analyzed OpenAI's GPT-OSS model and extracted comprehensive documentation about the Harmony Response Format (HRF) from the AI Makerspace video. This presents a significant opportunity to enhance our agent architecture.

### Key Findings from Analysis
Our video processing pipeline extracted 450+ lines of technical documentation revealing:

#### 1. **Harmony Response Format (HRF)**
- Extends traditional `system/user/assistant` with structured metadata
- Introduces **channels**: `analysis`, `commentary`, `final`
- Adds **recipients**: `user`, `assistant`, `tool`
- Supports **formats**: `plain`, `json`, `typescript`

#### 2. **Code Patterns Discovered**
```python
from openai_harmony import Chat, Role, Channel, HarmonyTemplate

system_msg = HarmonyTemplate.system()
system_msg.set_valid_channels([Channel.ANALYSIS, Channel.COMMENTARY, Channel.FINAL])

chat.add_user("What is the weather in Tokyo?")
response = chat.complete(model="gpt-oss-120b")
print(response.final_content)  # Only shows 'final' channel
print(response.analysis)       # Shows 'analysis' channel thinking
```

#### 3. **Model Architecture**
- 20B/120B parameter MoE (Mixture of Experts)
- Apache 2.0 licensed, fully open-weight
- Optimized for on-premise deployment
- "Deep fried" = extensive post-training safety measures

### üéØ Research Objectives

#### Phase 1: Architecture Analysis
- [ ] Map HRF channels to Luanti agent thought processes
- [ ] Design mapping between game actions and HRF tools
- [ ] Evaluate channel-based reasoning for multi-agent coordination

#### Phase 2: Implementation Exploration
- [ ] Prototype HRF-style message passing between agents
- [ ] Implement channel separation for agent introspection
- [ ] Test `analysis` channel for debugging agent decisions
- [ ] Use `commentary` channel for agent learning/reflection
- [ ] Reserve `final` channel for executed game actions

#### Phase 3: Integration Patterns
- [ ] Design game-specific tool definitions in HRF format
- [ ] Create Luanti-specific prompting templates
- [ ] Implement recipient-aware message routing
- [ ] Add format-based payload handling (JSON for structured commands)

### üí° Specific Applications for Luanti Voyager

#### 1. **Enhanced Agent Reasoning**
```python
# Agent's internal thought process
msg_analysis = Message(
    role="assistant",
    channel="analysis",
    content="I need wood to build. Nearest tree is 10 blocks north."
)

# Agent's plan
msg_commentary = Message(
    role="assistant", 
    channel="commentary",
    content="Will gather 20 wood blocks for house construction."
)

# Actual game action
msg_final = Message(
    role="assistant",
    channel="final",
    recipient="game",
    format="json",
    content='{"action": "move", "direction": "north", "distance": 10}'
)
```

#### 2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
- Use channels to separate agent-to-agent communication from game actions
- `analysis` channel for shared world understanding
- `commentary` channel for negotiation and planning
- `final` channel for synchronized actions

#### 3. **Debugging and Observability**
- Channel separation allows selective logging
- Can observe agent "thinking" without action spam
- Better understanding of decision-making process

### üìä Expected Benefits

1. **Clearer Agent Architecture**: Separation of reasoning from action
2. **Better Debugging**: Channel-based introspection
3. **Improved Coordination**: Structured multi-agent communication
4. **Future-Proof**: Alignment with OpenAI's open-source direction
5. **Local Deployment**: GPT-OSS models can run on-premise

### üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Literature Review**: Research other projects using HRF
2. **Prototype**: Build minimal HRF-based agent
3. **Benchmark**: Compare with current agent architecture
4. **RFC**: Create formal proposal if results are promising
