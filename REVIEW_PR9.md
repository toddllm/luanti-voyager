@cp90-pixel Thanks for continuing the work with adaptive learning. Initial review:
- This branch includes the entire community challenge commit from PR #8 (`dd3089e`). Once PR #8 is merged, please rebase so PR #9 only contains the adaptive learning changes.
- The `uuid4` import issue persists here because it pulls in the same code. Fixing it in PR #8 and rebasing will resolve it.
- Adding unit tests or examples for `learning.py` would help verify the new behavior.

These changes depend on PR #8, so merge that one first, then rebase and refine this PR.
